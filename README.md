My notes

To see the output of the html files 
use the append the html github link with https://htmlpreview.github.io/?

Eg:
https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/AngelSulochana/learning-html-css-javascript/blob/main/css/index.html


Html is the structure of page
Css is the style to the sctructure of page

CSS has properties and values 
Eg color is property and white is value in color:white;
